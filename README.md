## 1. Introduction
This document defines the rules for contributing to PetCharm. The goal is to maintain clean code, professional collaboration, and a smooth workflow for all contributors.

## 2. Commit Conventions
All commits should be short, clear, and use the following structure:
- feat: new feature
- fix: bug fix
- docs: documentation changes
- style: formatting or style adjustments (no logic changes)
- refactor: code improvements without altering behavior
- chore: maintenance tasks (dependencies, configs, etc.)

## 3. Branching 
This project will use **Gitflow** as the branching model
- `main` - Final product
- `dev` - Main development branch
- `feature/{feature-name}` - New features
- `bugfix/{issue-number}` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/{issue-number}` - Critical production fixes
- `release/{version}` - Pre-release branch for testing

### Guidelines
- Always create branches from dev.
- Use descriptive names (avoid personal names).
- Submit pull requests for review before merging.
- Ensure code is tested before requesting merge.

## 4. Libraries 
- Languages: TypeScript, HTML, CSS
- Framework: React
- Build Tool: Vite
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Package Manager: npm
- Linting & Formatting: ESLint, Prettier
- Hosting: Firebase or Netlify

## 5. Coding Style
- Code must be clean, consistent, and easy to read.
- Variable and function names should be descriptive.
